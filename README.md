# What is it?

Here is the source code developed during an internship "Decoding auditory cortex using high-dimensional regression" at PARIETAL (Inria lab).

It is released under BSD 3-clause license.

# How can I reproduce results?

First of all, you need stimuli: they were communicated privately by Michael Hanke. So they are absent in this repo.

# Dependencies

Plenty of them. NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, gensim, nilearn, nsgt. Optionally, pycortex or FSL to visualization, glove, FFTW.
